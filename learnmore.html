    <h1 class="h1class">‎‎‎	Terms & Conditions</h1>
   <h2>1. Booking your Holiday</h2>
   <p> a) Your contract in respect of your holiday is made with My India Travel & Tourism (‘the Company‘), registered in Oman and all bookings are subject to these terms and conditions. <br>
    b) All communications by the Company in relation to your holiday will be sent to the address stated on the booking form. <br>
    c) All bookings must be made through an authorised representative of the Company. At the time of booking the Company booking form must be completed and submitted together with a deposit of 50% of the total cost of the booking. <br>
    d) Receipt of the deposit and booking form by the Company does neither guarantee nor imply confirmation of the booking. No booking shall be confirmed until the Company issues a written notice. The Company reserves the right to refuse a booking without giving any reason and shall in that event return any deposit received.  <br>
    <h2>2. Price Policy</h2>
    a) The Company is under no obligation to furnish a breakdown of the costs involved in a holiday. <br>
b) The Company reserves the right to notify you of any increase in price before accepting your booking. <br>
c) After a Confirmation Invoice has been issued, unless you choose to pay for your holiday in full at the time of booking, the price of your holiday is subject to the possibilities of surcharges in certain limited circumstances. However, a surcharge will only be levied to allow for variations in transportation cost, including cost of fuel, increase in normal published airfares, taxes or fees chargeable for services such as landing taxes at airports, the exchange rate applied to the particular package or if the government or regulatory body introduce an increase of taxes. Even then, the Company will absorb an amount equal to 2% of your holiday price (excluding insurance premiums and amendment charges) before passing on any surcharge to you. Only amounts in excess of this 2% will be surcharged. Surcharges will be notified by a revised Confirmation Invoice sent to you. <br>

Compensation may be payable in cases of major change as detailed below. <br>
b) No compensation will be payable for minor changes. Minor changes include minimal changes to departure and arrival times, changes to the type of aircraft used and restaurant and accommodation changes to a comparable or superior standard. <br>
